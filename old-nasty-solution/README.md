This Go code is my first approach at implementing the Hanoi algorithm. This is not a safe nor efficient solution, but I choose to include it as a reminder. 
Learning from our mistakes is crucial, so I tend to remind myself of (at least) some of 'em.  
Let's break down the code and its functions:

1. **Package Declaration and Imports:**
   - The package is declared as `main`, which means it is the entry point of the program.
   - It imports the "math-depot" package with the alias `maths`, which contains some mathematical utilities or custom types.

2. **Global Variable:**
   - `stacks_` is declared as a slice of pointers to slices of integers. This is used to store multiple stacks, where each stack is represented as a pointer to a slice.

3. **Main Function:**
   - Initializes `n` to 10.
   - Creates three slices: `stack1`, `stack2`, and `stack3`, with initial sizes of 10 and 0, respectively.
   - Stores pointers to these slices in the `stacks_` variable.
   - Initializes `j` to 10 and populates `stack1` with values from 10 to 0 in reverse order.
   - Creates an instance of `maths.ModCounter` with a range from 0 to 3.
   - Calls `movePartition` with initial parameters to start the partitioning process.

4. **movePartition Function:**
   - Recursively processes the stacks to move elements around based on the `counter` and `root` value.
   - Uses a counter to determine which stack to process next and which stack to append to.
   - Calls `order` to find the correct position to insert the next element.
   - Handles recursive calls to process different stacks based on the `counter`.

5. **order Function:**
   - Determines the index to insert a value in the given stack so that the stack remains sorted.
   - Returns the index just after the first element that is less than or equal to the given value.

6. **nextAvailableBufferStack Function:**
   - Updates the `counter` and returns the next available stack index.
   - This function seems to handle the rotation of stack indices using the modulo operation.

7. **popStack Function:**
   - Takes a slice and a range to pop elements and returns them.
   - This function seems to be intended for popping a sublist but is not used in the provided code.

8. **pop Function:**
   - Removes and returns the last element of the given stack.
   - This is a straightforward implementation of the "pop" operation for slices.

9. **addToStack Function:**
   - Appends a given value to the destination stack.
   - This is a simple utility function to add an element to a slice.

### Summary:
The code initializes three stacks, populates one of them, and then uses a recursive partitioning algorithm to rearrange the elements across the stacks. The `movePartition` function is the core logic that decides which elements go where, and it uses the `ModCounter` to manage the flow of elements between the stacks. The `order` function helps in maintaining the sorted order within each stack.

### Potential Issues:
[//]: # (- The `popStack` function is defined but not used in the provided code. It might be part of a larger design that was not fully implemented.)
[//]: # (- The code assumes the existence of `maths.ModuloCounter`, which is not standard Go naming and might indicate a custom or imported type from the "math-depot" package.)
- The recursive calls in `movePartition` could lead to stack overflow if not managed properly, especially with large inputs.
