This code is a Go program that implements the classic Tower of Hanoi puzzle solution. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how it works:

1. **Main Function**:
   ```go
   func main() {
       move(4, "A", "B", "C")
   }
   ```
   - `func main()`: Defines the main function, which is the starting point of the program.
   - `move(4, "A", "B", "C")`: Calls the `move` function with four disks starting from tower 'A', moving to tower 'B' using tower 'C' as the buffer.

2. **Move Function**:
   ```go
   func move(n int, src, dest, buffer string) {
       if n == 1 {
           fmt.Printf("%d : %s  --> %s\n", n, src, dest)
           return
       }
       move(n-1, src, buffer, dest)
       fmt.Printf("%d : %s  --> %s\n", n, src, dest)
       move(n-1, buffer, dest, src)
   }
   ```
   - `func move(n int, src, dest, buffer string)`: Defines the `move` function, which takes four parameters:
     - `n`: The number of disks to move.
     - `src`: The source tower (disk origin).
     - `dest`: The destination tower (disk destination).
     - `buffer`: The buffer tower (used for intermediate storage during the move).
   - The function uses recursion to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem.
   - **Base Case**:
     ```go
     if n == 1 {
         fmt.Printf("%d : %s  --> %s\n", n, src, dest)
         return
     }```
     - When there is only one disk (`n == 1`), it directly moves the disk from the source tower to the destination tower and prints the move.

   - **Recursive Case**:
     ```go
     move(n-1, src, buffer, dest)
     fmt.Printf("%d : %s  --> %s\n", n, src, dest)
     move(n-1, buffer, dest, src)
     ```
     - For more than one disk (`n > 1`), it follows these steps:
       1. Move `n-1` disks from the source tower (`src`) to the buffer tower (`buffer`), using the destination tower (`dest`) as the intermediate buffer. This recursive call moves the smaller problem towards the base case.
       2. Move the nth disk (the largest) directly from the source tower (`src`) to the destination tower (`dest`), and prints the move.
       3. Move the `n-1` disks from the buffer tower (`buffer`) to the destination tower (`dest`), using the source tower (`src`) as the intermediate buffer. Again, this is a recursive call that reduces the problem size by one.

In summary, the code implements the recursive solution to the Tower of Hanoi puzzle, where it moves `n` disks from the source tower to the destination tower using a buffer tower, and prints each move. The base case handles the simplest scenario (one disk), while the recursive case breaks down the problem into smaller subproblems, each time reducing the number of disks to move by one.
